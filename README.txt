This is an extractor program I wrote, purely as an academic exercise.
It accessed files in a cloud storage directory hosting the links behind NFT tokens for an artist's archive, which were minted by the company without permission from the artist or their estate; this was written to see how secure that system is.
Once I figured out the link to the digital object behind the NFT's digital token, I wrote this. It can download the entire directory to the local disk.
Due to issues with linking the cURL library on VSCODE, and working on a short timeframe, I decided to try using the system(wget) command.
