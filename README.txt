This is a rudimentary JPEG extractor program I wrote, purely as an academic exercise to test how securely stored some NFT objects were.
It accessed files in a cloud storage directory hosting the objects linked to by NFT tokens for a historically significant artist's digitized archive.
I discovered that the cloud storage was insecure and could be accessed by anyone able to figure out the link to the full-resolution file directory (even after the tokens were removed from the public marketplace for unknown reasons).
Because each file was named from e.g. 1.jpg â†’ 12345.jpg due to injudicious archival handling/filenaming, the whole 10000+ images could be downloaded to a local disk in under an hour.
After successfully executing the program and downloading 200+ files in sequence, I deleted them from my harddrive permanently and shelved this program.
Due to issues with linking the cURL library on VSCODE, and working on a short timeframe, I decided to try using the system(wget) command.
