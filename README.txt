This is a rudimentary JPEG extractor program I wrote, purely as an academic exercise to test how securely stored some NFT objects were.
It accessed files in a cloud storage directory hosting the links behind NFT tokens for historically significant artist's digitized archive; this was written after finding out that the cloud storage system was not secure and could be accessed by anyone able to figure out the link to the directory, even after the tokens were removed from the public marketplace for unknown reasons. 
Because the directory to the full-resolution objects could be accessed with the link, and because each file was named from e.g. 1.jpg â†’ 12345.jpg due to improper archival handling/filenaming, the whole 10000+ images could be downloaded to a local disk in under an hour.
Due to issues with linking the cURL library on VSCODE, and working on a short timeframe, I decided to try using the system(wget) command.
